        The Universe has trillions and trillions of years ahead.
    Our Sun is still young. But eventually, it will die. If we are alive by the time, we will need a great technology to survive.
    I wish I could live forever just to see what happens to the Universe and the progress of the Human Race.
    Since it is impossible, my dream is to contribute to the progress and see as much as I can. </p>
<p class="mainbody" id="container"> I study mathematics because it is the key to our existence and all the possible inventions and discoveries.
    I want to contribute to our society and make our usual life easier, so we can take more time to think and reach another step of universal development.
</p>-->


<p class="mainbody"> I have graduated the University of Minnesota with major in mathematics and minor in computer science.
    <br> I like technology, urban studies, arts, literature, <br> and foreign languages.
    <br>I like learning new things and I also like to finish what I started.
    <br> One of my dreams is to work on the world's technological progress and
    achieve great results for all of us.
